# iot-agriculture-mobile-app
This mobile app project was developed as a hobby to retrieve real-time data from the growth process of plants. The user is also able to control the components such as water pumps, ventilation and a real-time camera to monitor the growth process. The mobile app stack includes the use of DART, Flutter and Android Studio. The back-end was powered by Firebase, Python and a Raspberry Pi microcomputer to power the controllers and sensors. The code illustrated here is only a fraction of the entire mobile application.
